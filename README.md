# PS2-2-TSV

I needed to convert a PS2 file to a TSV (Tab Separated File), and wrote this simple script. Maybe it will be useful for someone else.

## PS2

PS2 files are used by banks in Portugal, don't know if they are used anywhere else.
I followed [this pdf](http://corp.millenniumbcp.pt/pt/public/Documents/Layout_PS2_3.pdf) as a guide to the format.
